# Analyze Documents


# Format Documents

The purpose of this script is to take a document, which will be inputted as a text file, and
copy the document and format it nicely, saving the formatted version in a new folder. The script
will also output the an array of all the words in the formatted document. Run this script only once when you add new text files.
You do not need to run it again until you add more.

# Statistical Analysis of Word Spectrum

Analyze the frequency that words occur ordered by their first appearance in the document.

# Graph Analysis

Create a graph where there is a node for every unique word and an edge between nodes
if they occur within a certain distance between one another in a document.

# Graph Analysis of Frequency Bands (Experimental)

Takes the word spectrum and groups words with similar probability to occur together. Create
nodes for each of these bands and create an edge between the nodes if the words within the bands occur
near each other. Maybe give each node an internal substructure as well.
