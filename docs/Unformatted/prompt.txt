There was a sharp divide where the fields ended and the forest began, something in the quality of the light. Too many shadows in the forest, perhaps.

The hunter walked down the thin dirt trail that separated one from the other. In one scarred hand he held a great storm-lantern, its orange light low behind the metal guard. His leather coat was worn at the elbows, from too much crawling in the mud, and stitched together across the back in many places where claws unseen had rent the material in sharp lines.

Ahead the sun was setting slowly, and the falling light seemed to bulk up the forest somehow, the individual shadows coalescing until it was nothing but a solid wall of darkness to his left.

He reached the crossroads and swung his bag down from his shoulder, pawing through his supplies. He was carrying little; a small bottle of the dark liquor, culled from the milk-flowers, that was said to kill pain. A few strips of meat jerky. Finally, a small embroidered sign, in neat cross-stitch, that said simply "Kill Me".

He picked up the sign, weighing it in his hands. His gaze was caught, for a few seconds, by the roadsign. Made of aged wood, it stood well clear of the forest. One arm, relatively clean, with the lettering freshly painted, pointed away from the forest to a town he didn't know. The other, overgrown with moss, pointed deep into the woods.

He sighed, and unhitched a leather strap from around his neck. Taking a knife from his belt he fashioned small holes in the frame of the embroidered "Kill Me" sign. He threaded the leather through these, and knotted it firmly. Finally, he placed the sign around his neck.

The sun had almost finished sinking below the horizon. He took a few steps towards the forest, raising the storm-lantern's shield to cast a thin beam of orange light onto the ground ahead of him. A faint trail was visible, leading deep into the heart of the forest. This he began to tread.

Within a few seconds the darkness of the forest had swallowed him. He didn't bother to look up as he ventured further into the trees. Outside the stars and moon would come out to shine, but neither was ever visible through the thick canopy of the trees around him.

From time to time the hunter passed a landmark he recognized. A great oak, its trunk split in two by some unfortunate stroke of lightning, a few pairs of red eyes glinting from its innards. The grey stone that lay by the side of the road, shaped something like a human figure bent over in pain. He stopped only briefly at each one, murmuring to himself while his watchful eyes scanned the darkness around him.

The light from the storm-lamp threw the landscape into uneasy relief, not penetrating far into the gloom. From time to time a shadow seemed to evaporate as the light touched it, streaming past his eyes in a vivid rush of deep purple, but he paid these no heed. The early tricks of the forest were nothing to be afraid of; the important thing was to keep one's wits.

The whispers were the next thing to start, sly laughter from trees he'd just passed. This too he had learned to ignore on other trips, raising the storm lantern a little higher and rattling it to show he was not afraid. They faded, but did not entirely die away.

When he reached the second oak, the one half-choked by thick vines, a bloated white owl, its talons stained with dark blood, fluttered down to land on a branch in front of him. Its head rotated to reveal the second face behind.

"What are you seeking, hunter?"

The hunter angled the sign across his chest up so the light from the lantern caught it. "Someone who can read, gremlin. Get gone into the dark."

The owl laughed and flew away to the west. The hunter went east.

At the third oak, which grew from the ruins of some vast temple, its roots gripping through a broken marble altar, the hunter paused to eat a few strips of meat. The pool that ran the length of the temple was untouched by the decay around it, and he stared into the depths. A few maidens appeared reflected it in, shining and beautifully sad, but when he turned away they were only crows, hopping in and out of collapsed pillars.

"Will you?" he asked them, closing his bag again with greasy fingers, but the maidens shook their heads and the crows only cawed at him, so he went onwards.

The forest had begun to grow warmer, and the air a little more humid. The hunter panted a little in the heat, and undid a few of the toggles on his leather coat, revealing the rusty chainmail beneath. Above the sign that sat heavy on his chest the tooth of a dragon dangled, inscribed with a single rune.

Along with the heat the trees were changing, pine and beech giving way to mahogany and palms that still had taken on the ash-grey pallor of the forest. The voices had stopped, now, but from time-to-time the harsh sounds of monkeys screeching would reach him from the canopy far above.

Once there was an all-too-human scream, and the hunter paused, grimacing. Then he saw the lithe form of the panther, a dead monkey clenched in its jaws, and shook his head.

The fifth oak was toppled, rotted from the inside by a vast horde of termites that had since built a tower almost as high as the original tree. The hunter bowed in front of it, as was customary, and waited while the scurrying workers brought news of his scent to the hive.

With a few minutes the side of the tower was covered with the scurrying insects, forming a vast face that looked down on him. "Kill...Me..." the face mused, its voice made from the sound of a thousand thousand mandibles rubbing against each other. "And why would we do that, little hunter?"

The hunter smiled at a private joke. "I don't need you to, thank you. Just testing the principle of the thing. Thank you, your Highness."

He walked on. The mind of the hive watched after him for a few minutes, thinking on what had occurred, then sent a few hundred soldiers out after him, to observe. Half would no doubt be lost to the birds, but the rest would learn something that could be regurgitated into the memory-paper walls of the hive.

Before he reached the sixth oak the hunter stopped and cast about him in the undergrowth, gathering mud and moss that he formed into two plugs for his ears. The sounds of the forest instantly died away and he continued with his slow heartbeat the only sound his ears.

Soon enough he saw the glow of sunlight through the trees, though he knew only a few hours had passed since he entered the forest. With one hand he freed the big knife that rested on his hip and crept forward slowly. With the light of the clearing to see by there was no longer any need for the storm-lantern and this he gently turned down to almost nothing before clipping it to his belt.

The sixth oak was still growing green and true, by the sides of a babbling brook. He walked forwards into the clearing, and his heart was instantly glad. His feet passed from the rough mud of the path to soft green grass, and overhead the sun's warmth beat down on him.

In the distance, gathered round the roots of the sixth oak, he could see trestle tables where his fellows were sat with full horns of beer in front of them. The conversation seemed raucous and full of fun, though the plugs of mud in his ears prevented him from hearing it.

A maiden approached him from the tables, offering him a cup of wine to drink. She seemed perplexed at his lack of hearing. The plugs suddenly seemed a foolish precaution, and he reached up with one fumbling hand to flick them out. Instantly he was greeted by the sounds of a merry song and he grinned wider.

The maiden spoke again. "A drink, Sir Hunter?" He took it gladly and drained it in one, feeling the fine wine reach down to the lingering darkness in his bones.

Abruptly, the light faded and he cried out. He was back in the dark forest, slumped on his knees in front of a shadowy figure. Behind her he could see the trestle tables revealed to be nothing but diseased roots of the sixth oak. The tree itself was infested with the crows that had been his constant companion since entering the forest. They were clustered round small bundles in the branches; with horror he recognized them as the heads of other hunters he had known. Their bodies lay around the trunk, some with weapons still clutched in their hands.

The figure above him looked down with amusement. "You have drunk my wine, Sir Hunter," it said, "and now you must do as I say - is that not hospitality? First, stand."

The hunter found himself compelled to do so by the wine still burning in his marrow. He came stiffly to attention in front of the figure. Looking at it eye-to-eye now he saw an old crone, her skin withered around burning yellow eyes that captured his gaze.

"Turn around, Sir Hunter," she said softly, "and look back at the way you came."

Again he was compelled to, and he would have cried out if he could, for the path behind him had vanished through some magic and there was no way out of the clearing.

"Turn around again and face me."

Her eyes drank him in greedily, noting the scars on his face and the storm-lantern at his waist.

"Ho ho", said the witch softly, "a rich prize indeed to have wandered into my larder. But what is that around your neck?"

Her eyes wandered across the dragon-tooth, and then down to the cross-stitched sign.

"A curious thing for a hunter to wear," the witch sneered, "'Kill Me' - as if -"

The hunter watched passively as his right hand came up and obediently buried the long knife in her throat.
