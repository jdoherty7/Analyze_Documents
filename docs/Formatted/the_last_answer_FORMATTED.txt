murray templeton was fortyfive years old in the prime of life and with all parts of his body in perfect working order except for certain key portions of his coronary arteries but that was enough

the pain had come suddenly had mounted to an unbearable peak and had then ebbed steadilyhe could feel his breath slowing and a kind of gathering peace washing over him

there is no pleasure like the absence of pain – immediately after painmurray felt an almost giddy lightness as though he were lifting in the air and hovering

he opened his eyes and noted with distant amusement that the others in the room were still agitatedhe had been in the laboratory when the pain had struck quite without warning and when he had staggered he had heard surprised outcries from the others before everything vanished into overwhelming agony

now with the pain gone the others were still hovering still anxious still gathered about his fallen body –– which he suddenly realised he was looking down on

he was down there sprawled face contortedhe was up here at peace and watching

he thought miracle of miraclesthe lifeafterlife nuts were right

and although that was a humiliating way for an atheistic physicist to die he felt only the mildest surprise and no alteration of the peace in which he was immersed

he thought there should be some angel – or something – coming for me

the earthly scene was fadingdarkness was invading his consciousness and off in a distance as a last glimmer of sight there was a figure of light vaguely human in form and radiating warmth

murray thought what a joke on mei’m going to heaven

even as he thought that the light faded but the warmth remainedthere was no lessening of the peace even though in all the universe only he remained – and the voice

the voice said “i have done this so often and yet i still have the capacity to be pleased at success”

it was in murray’s mind to say something but he was not conscious of possessing a mouth tongue or vocal chordsnevertheless tried to make a soundhe tried mouthlessly to hum words or breathe them or just push them out by a contraction of – something

and they came outhe heard his own voice quite recognisable and his own words infinitely clear

murray said “is this heaven”

the voice said “this is no place as you understand place”

murray was embarrassed but the next question had to be asked“pardon me if i sound like a jackassare you god”

without changing intonation or in any way marring the perfection of the sound the voice managed to sound amused“it is strange that i am always asked that in of course an infinite number of waysthere is no answer i can give that you would comprehendi am – which is all that i can say significantly and you may cover that with any word or concept you please”

murray said “and what am ia soulor am i only personified existence too”he tried not to sound sarcastic but it seemed to him that he had failedhe thought then fleetingly of adding a ‘your grace’ or ‘holy one’ or something to counteract the sarcasm and could not bring himself to do so even though for the first time in his existence he speculated on the possibility of being punished for his insolence – or sin – with hell and what that might be like

the voice did not sound offended“you are easy to explain – even to youyou may call yourself a soul if that pleases you but what you are is a nexus of electromagnetic forces so arranged that all the interconnections and interrelationships are exactly imitative of those of your brain in your universeexistence – down to the smallest detailtherefore you have your capacity for thought your memories your personalityit still seems to you that you are you”

murray found himself incredulous“you mean the essence of my brain was permanent”

“not at allthere is nothing about you that is permanent except what i choose to make soi formed the nexusi constructed it while you had physical existence and adjusted it to the moment when the existence failed”

the voice seemed distinctly pleased with itself and went on after a moment’s pause“an intricate but entirely precise constructioni could of course do it for every human being on your world but i am pleased that i do notthere is pleasure in the selection”

“you choose very few then”

“very few”

“and what happens to the rest”

“oblivion – oh of course you imagine a hell”

murray would have flushed if he had the capacity to do sohe said “i do notit is spoken ofstill i would scarcely have thought i was virtuous enough to have attracted your attention as one of the elect”

“virtuous – ah i see what you meanit is troublesome to have to force my thinking small enough to permeate yoursno i have chosen you for your capacity for thought as i choose others in quadrillions from all the intelligent species of the universe”

murray found himself suddenly curious the habit of a lifetimehe said “do you choose them all yourself or are there others like you”

for a fleeting moment murray thought there was an impatient reaction to that but when the voice came it was unmoved“whether or not there are others is irrelevant to youthis universe is mine and mine aloneit is my invention my construction intended for my purpose alone”

“and yet with quadrillions of nexi you have formed you spend time with meam i that important”

the voice said “you are not important at alli am also with others in a way which to your perception would seem simultaneous”

“and yet you are one”

again amusementthe voice said “you seek to trap me into an inconsistencyif you were an amoeba who could consider individuality only in connection with single cells and if you were to ask a sperm whale made up of thirty quadrillion cells whether it was one or many how could the sperm whale answer in a way that would be comprehensible to the amoeba”

murray said dryly “i’ll think about itit may become comprehensible”

“exactlythat is your functionyou will think”

“to what endyou already know everything i suppose”

the voice said “even if i knew everything i could not know that i know everything”

murray said “that sounds like a bit of eastern philosophy – something that sounds profound precisely because it has no meaning”

the voice said “you have promiseyou answer my paradox with a paradox – except that mine is not a paradoxconsideri have existed eternally but what does that meanit means i cannot remember having come into existenceif i could i would not have existed eternallyif i cannot remember having come into existence then there is at least one thing – the nature of my coming into existence – that i do not know

“then too although what i know is infinite it is also true that what there is to know is infinite and how can i be sure that both infinities are equalthe infinity of potential knowledge may be infinitely greater than the infinity of my actual knowledgehere is a simple example if i knew every one of the even integers i would know an infinite number of items and yet i would still not know a single odd integer”

murray said “but the odd integers can be derivedif you divide every even integer in the entire infinite series by two you will get another infinite series which will contain within it the infinite series of odd integers”

the voice said “you have the ideai am pleasedit will be your task to find other such ways far more difficult ones from the known to the notyetknownyou have your memoriesyou will remember all the data you have ever collected or learned or that you have or will deduce from that dataif necessary you will be allowed to learn what additional data you will consider relevant to the problems you set yourself”

“could you not do all that for yourself”

the voice said “i can but it is more interesting this wayi constructed the universe in order to have more facts to deal withi inserted the uncertainty principle entropy and other randomisation factors to make the whole not instantly obviousit has worked well for it has amused me throughout its entire existence

“i then allowed complexities that produced first life and then intelligence and use it as a source for a research team not because i need the aid but because it would introduce a new random factori found i could not predict the next interesting piece of knowledge gained where it would come from by what means derived”

murray said “does that ever happen”

“certainlya century doesn’t pass in which some interesting item doesn’t appear somewhere”

“something that you could have thought of yourself but had not done so yet”

“yes”

murray said “do you actually think there’s a chance of my obliging you in this manner”

“in the next centuryvirtually nonein the long run though your success is certain since you will be engaged eternally”

murray said “i will be thinking through eternityforever”

“yes”

“to what end”

“i have told youto find new knowledge”

“but beyond thatfor what purpose am i to find new knowledge”

“it was what you did in your universebound lifewhat was its purpose then”

murray said “to gain new knowledge that only i could gainto receive the praise of my fellowsto feel the satisfaction of accomplishment knowing that i had only a short time allotted me for the purpose – now i would gain only what you could gain yourself if you wished to take a small bit of troubleyou cannot praise me you can only be amusedand there is no credit or satisfaction in accomplishment when i have all eternity to do it in”

the voice said “and you do not find thought and discovery worthwhile in itselfyou do not find it requiring no further purpose”

“for a finite time yesnot for all eternity”

“i see your pointnevertheless you have no choice”

“you say i am to thinkyou cannot make me do so”

the voice said “i do not wish to constrain you directlyi will not need tosince you can do nothing but think you will thinkyou do not know how not to think”

“then i will give myself a goali will invent a purpose”

the voice said tolerantly “that you can certainly do”

“i have already found a purpose”

“may i know what it is”

“you know alreadyi know we are not speaking in the ordinary fashionyou adjust my nexus is such a way that i believe i hear you and i believe i speak but you transfer thoughts to me and from me directlyand when my nexus changes with my thoughts you are at once aware of them and do not need my voluntary transmission”

the voice said “you are surprisingly correcti am pleased – but it also pleases me to have you tell me your thoughts voluntarily”

“then i will tell youthe purpose of my thinking will be to discover a way to disrupt this nexus of me that you have createdi do not want to think for no purpose but to amuse youi do not want to think forever to amuse youi do not want to exist forever to amuse youall my thinking will be directed toward ending the nexusthat would amuse me”

the voice said “i have no objection to thateven concentrated thought on ending your own existence may in spite of you come up with something new and interestingand of course if you succeed in this suicide attempt you will have accomplished nothing for i would instantly reconstruct you and in such a way as to make your method of suicide impossibleand if you found another and still more subtle fashion of disrupting yourself i would reconstruct you with that possibility eliminated and so onit could be an interesting game but you will nevertheless exist eternallyit is my will”

murray felt a quaver but the words came out with a perfect calm“am i in hell then after allyou have implied there is none but if this were hell you would lie to us as part of the game of hell”

the voice said “in that case of what use is it to assure you that you are not in hellnevertheless i assure youthere is here neither heaven nor hellthere is only myself”

murray said “consider then that my thoughts may be useless to youif i come up with nothing useful will it not be worth your while to – disassemble me and take no further trouble with me”

“as a rewardyou want nirvana as the prize of failure and you intend to assure me failurethere is no bargain thereyou will not failwith all eternity before you you cannot avoid having at least one interesting thought however you try against it”

“then i will create another purpose for myselfi will not try to destroy myselfi will set as my goal the humiliation of youi will think of something you have not only never thought of but never could think ofi will think of the last answer beyond which there is no knowledge further”

the voice said “you do not understand the nature of the infinitethere may be things i have not yet troubled to knowthere cannot be anything i cannot know”

murray said thoughtfully “you cannot know your beginningyou have said sotherefore you cannot know your endvery well thenthat will be my purpose and that will be the last answeri will not destroy myselfi will destroy you – if you do not destroy me first”

the voice said “ahyou come to that in rather less than average timei would have thought it would have taken you longerthere is not one of those i have with me in this existence of perfect and eternal thought that does not have the ambition of destroying meit cannot be done”

murray said “i have all eternity to think of a way of destroying you”

the voice said equably “then try to think of it”and it was gone

but murray had his purpose now and was content

for what could any entity conscious of eternal existence want – but an end

for what else had the voice been searching for countless billions of yearsand for what other reason had intelligence been created and certain specimens salvaged and put to work but to aid in that great searchand murray intended that it would be he and he alone who would succeed

carefully and with the thrill of purpose murray began to think

he had plenty of time
